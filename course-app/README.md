# course-app
This Vue.js application allows users to browse and search for courses, view course details, and sort courses based on organisation and pacing. The app also allows users to mark courses as favourites and store them using Vuex.

# Requirements
Implement a search functionality that allows users to search for courses by title or keyword.
Use Vuetify to display search results in visually appealing and responsive UI cards, showing course image, title, short description, organisation, and pacing.
Implement a course details page that displays more information about a selected course, such as title, description, and available data.
Allow users to mark courses as favourites and store their favourites using Vuex. Display recent marked 3 courses at the bottom of the course detail page.
Use Vue.js to build components and manage the application state following best practices for development, such as using computed properties, event handling, and component lifecycle hooks.
Provide proper error handling, such as displaying error messages when API requests fail or when no search results are found.
Use Vue Router to implement routing for different views, such as search results, course details, and favourites.
